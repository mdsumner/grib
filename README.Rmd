The goal of grib is to read GRIB and GRIB2 files. Right now it does pretty much nothing and is proof-of-concept only.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("paleolimbot/grib")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(grib)
grib2_info("~/Desktop/CMC_hrdps_maritimes_PRATE_SFC_0_ps2.5km_2020091400_P001-00.grib2")
data <- grib2_field(
  "~/Desktop/CMC_hrdps_maritimes_PRATE_SFC_0_ps2.5km_2020091400_P001-00.grib2",
  expand = TRUE
)
summary(data$fld)
```
